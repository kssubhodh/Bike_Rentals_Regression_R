# Bike_Rentals_Regression_R

* Developed a regression model in R to predict daily bike-sharing demand for Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare system using UCI Machine Learning Repository data, improving RÂ² by 14% through feature selection and transformations
* Analyzed weather, temporal, and seasonal factors to identify trends, such as a quadratic relationship between temperature and demand, providing actionable insights for resource allocation.
* Validated the model using cross-validation and PRESS statistics in R to ensure predictive accuracy and robustness, enabling data-driven optimization of bike-sharing operations
